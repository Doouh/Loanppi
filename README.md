## Introduction

Final project for Holberton School fundations process in partnership with Rappi. Rappi is a mega high growth, Series C, consumer tech startup looking to be the everything store of Latin America. By delivery connects users who want to purchase prepared foods, groceries, clothes, and virtually anything with independent contractors who can fulfill those needs. Although Rappi is a new company and truly lives the startup reality, it is already operating in Colombia, MÃ©xico, Brazil, Argentina & Chile.<br>
The startup is constantly looking for innovative ideas willing to change the future and better off the lives of the people in order to build and shape a new reality in LatAm, specially in Colombia and for that reason is always looking to expand its workforce.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, there are people who are eager to enter and work as a rappitenderos (the ones who deliver the food and services in bikes) and the vehicle is part of the requirements when the applicants are applying to the offer.<br>
Therefore, the people who want to get a job as rappitenderos face the need to acquire a vehicle, however they happen to not count with the funds to do it and their profiles are not appealing for the financial entities in order to get a loan.<br>
Furthermore, people nowadays are always looking for different ways to get extra money for saving and with the app the people will be able to not just save some money and get some utilities from it, but also they will help other people to change their lives and better off their welfare.
As a result of these needs, is where LOANPPI appears, which is an CrowdLending app in an effort to finance bikes and driving licences for low-income people and get into a process of social transformacion.
